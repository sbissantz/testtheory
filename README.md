# Measurement matters!

This repository needs expansion. I decided to include references, podcasts,
videos, and other golden *nuggets of truth* (...whatever that means). Over
time, I try to include more and more resources to make two points clear:
Measurement matters! And I am personally convinced that quality science can't 
rises from bad measurements. I was a fool to believe statistical methods can
cope with bad data or fix screwed-up measurements. I was wrong!
Garbage-In-Garbage-Out. It is that simple. Be wiser than me.

That's why I'd like to share with you some of my wake-up calls. In general, I
highly recommend the works of Jessica Flake and Eiko Fried. But to jump right
off the ground; here are two papers of their impressive smorgasbord: 

- Fired & Flake (2018): (Measurement matters)[https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/measurement-matters]
- Flake & Fried (2020): (Measurement Schmeasurement)[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245920952393]

Kornbrot and their colleges joint in with the following article: 

- Kornbrot, Wiseman & Georgiou (2018) (Quality science from quality measurement)[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192808]

## Additional resources

Fried & Fried (2018) recognized that scientists often lack training, for
example, regarding validity theory, psychometrics, etc. Kindly they pooled
together some additional material on OSF (see: https://osf.io/zrkd4/). To
