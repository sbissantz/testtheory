# Measurement matters!

Measurement matters! And I am personally convinced that quality science can't
rises from bad measurements. I was a fool to believe statistical methods can
cope with bad data or even fix screwed-up measurements. I was wrong!
Garbage-In-Garbage-Out -- it is that simple. Be wiser than me.

To put words into action, I decided to expand this repository. The repo should
become a staging ares for a dozen important resources in my field. Including
references, podcasts, videos, and other golden *nuggets of truth* (...whatever
that means) is my first strike. Furthermore, I would love to complement the
collection with my own work in the field.

Let's modestly start with the first on. In general, I highly recommend the
works of Jessica Flake and Eiko Fried. Their works were like a wake-up call for
me. To save you some time and make you jump right off the ground; here are two
papers of their impressive smorgasbord: 

- Fired & Flake (2018): (Measurement matters)[https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/measurement-matters]
- Flake & Fried (2020): (Measurement Schmeasurement)[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245920952393]

Kornbrot and their colleges joint in with the following article: 

- Kornbrot, Wiseman & Georgiou (2018) (Quality science from quality measurement)[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192808]

## Additional resources

Fried & Fried (2018) recognized that scientists often lack training, for
example, regarding validity theory, psychometrics, etc. Kindly they pooled
together some additional material on OSF (see: https://osf.io/zrkd4/). To
